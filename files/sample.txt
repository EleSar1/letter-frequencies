On July 15th, 2025, at exactly 7:45 AM, Emma woke up to the sound of her alarm. 
"Time to start a new adventure!" she thought. She grabbed her backpack, checked her map, and headed out. 
Along the way, she saw 3 squirrels playing in the garden, a black cat crossing the street, and the colorful flowers blooming in the park. 
At the café, she ordered a coffee & croissant, sat by the window, and began writing in her journal.
Life felt unpredictable, exciting, and full of possibilities—just like the stories she loved to read.
